# Patch CQM Constraint Violation - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: Both Patch DWave CQM and Patch DWave BQM were returning infeasible solutions where multiple crops were assigned to single plots, violating the "at most one crop per plot" constraint.

**Root Cause**: Food group constraints in `solver_runner_BINARY.py` were incorrectly applied PER-PLOT instead of GLOBALLY, creating mathematically infeasible problems.

## Detailed Analysis

### The Infeasibility

With 10 plots, 27 foods, and 5 food groups:

**BEFORE (Incorrect)**:
```
For each of 10 plots:
  - At most 1 crop can be planted (plot assignment constraint)
  - At least 1 food from EACH of 5 groups must be planted (food group min)
  
Result: Each plot needs ≥5 crops but can only have ≤1 crop → INFEASIBLE!
```

This created 100 food group constraints (10 plots × 10 constraints per plot), making the problem impossible to solve feasibly.

### DWave's Behavior

When DWave CQM encounters an infeasible problem:
1. It correctly identifies the solution as infeasible (`is_feasible=False`)
2. It returns the "best infeasible solution" it found
3. This solution violates constraints but minimizes total violation

From test results:
```
Status: Infeasible
Crops per plot:
  ❌ Patch1: 3 crops
  ❌ Patch2: 2 crops
  ✓ Patch4: 1 crop
  ... 9 out of 10 plots violated

CQM reports: is_feasible=False (correct!)
```

## The Fix

### Code Changes

**File**: `solver_runner_BINARY.py`  
**Lines**: 473-507 (food group constraints section)

**BEFORE**:
```python
# Per-plot: Each plot needs 1 food from each group - WRONG!
for farm in farms:
    for group, constraints in food_group_constraints.items():
        cqm.add_constraint(
            sum(Y[(farm, food)] for food in foods_in_group) >= min_foods,
            label=f"Food_Group_Min_{group}_{farm}"
        )
```

**AFTER**:
```python
# Global: Across ALL plots, need at least min_foods from each group - CORRECT!
for group, constraints in food_group_constraints.items():
    foods_in_group = food_groups.get(group, [])
    if 'min_foods' in constraints:
        cqm.add_constraint(
            sum(Y[(farm, food)] for farm in farms for food in foods_in_group) >= min_foods,
            label=f"Food_Group_Min_{group}_Global"
        )
```

### Impact on Problem Size

**BEFORE**:
- Total constraints: 137
  - 10 plot assignment constraints
  - 27 min plots per crop
  - 100 food group constraints (10 per plot)

**AFTER**:
- Total constraints: 47
  - 10 plot assignment constraints
  - 27 min plots per crop
  - 10 food group constraints (global)

**Reduction**: 90 fewer constraints! (~66% reduction)

### Verification

Test confirmed the fix:
```
✓ Food group constraints: 10 (was 100)
✓ Each constraint spans all plots (50 variables for 5 foods × 10 plots)
✓ Problem is now mathematically feasible
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Feasibility
- DWave CQM should now find **feasible solutions** (`is_feasible=True`)
- Solutions should satisfy ALL constraints:
  - ✓ At most 1 crop per plot
  - ✓ At least 1 food from each group globally
  - ✓ Minimum plots per crop (if specified)

### Solution Quality
- Objective values should be comparable or better
- QPU time may decrease (simpler problem)
- Solutions will be valid for comparison with Gurobi

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Re-run comprehensive benchmark** with fixed code
2. **Verify all Patch solutions are feasible**
3. **Compare with previous results** - expect:
   - Higher feasibility rate
   - Different crop allocations
   - Possibly better objective values

## Files Modified

✅ `solver_runner_BINARY.py` - Fixed food group constraints (lines 473-507)

## Files to Review/Update

- ⚠️ `solver_runner.py` - Check if continuous formulation has same issue
- ⚠️ All existing benchmark results in `Benchmarks/COMPREHENSIVE/Patch_DWave*/` - Should be re-generated
- ⚠️ Analysis reports referencing Patch DWave results - May need updates

## Additional Notes

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. DWave correctly marked solutions as infeasible
2. But code still processed and validated these infeasible solutions
3. The validation function detected violations, confirming the issue
4. Without this targeted test, the per-plot vs global distinction wasn't obvious

### Lesson Learned

When designing optimization constraints:
- **Be explicit about scope**: Per-entity vs global
- **Test for feasibility**: Verify constraints don't conflict
- **Check problem size**: Unexpected constraint counts may indicate errors
- **Validate solutions**: Even "infeasible" ones can reveal issues

## Commands to Re-test

```bash
# Test the fix
python test_fixed_constraints.py

# Re-run benchmarks (when DWave quota available)
python comprehensive_benchmark.py

# Validate specific results
python test_patch_cqm_constraints.py
```

**Status**: ✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED  
**Next Step**: Re-run benchmarks to get valid feasible solutions  
**Expected Outcome**: Patch DWave CQM/BQM will now return feasible solutions without constraint violations
