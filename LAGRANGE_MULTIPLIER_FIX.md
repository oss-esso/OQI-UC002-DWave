# CORRECT Analysis: Why BQUBO is Slower Than PATCH

## The Data You Showed Me

**BQUBO (72 farms)**:
- hybrid_time: **65.7 seconds** ← SLOW
- is_feasible: **true** ← GOOD
- n_violations: **0**

**PATCH (50 plots)**:
- hybrid_time: **2.99 seconds** ← 22x FASTER
- is_feasible: **false** ← BAD!
- n_violations: **24** (plots with 2 crops assigned)
- utilization: **162%** (over-allocated)

**PATCH (100 plots)**:
- hybrid_time: **3.73 seconds** ← 18x FASTER
- is_feasible: **false** ← BAD!
- n_violations: **87** (plots with 2 crops assigned)
- utilization: **191%** (over-allocated)

## Root Cause: Manual Lagrange Multiplier

### BQUBO Approach (CORRECT)
```python
# solver_runner_BQUBO.py line 231
bqm, invert = cqm_to_bqm(cqm)  # No lagrange_multiplier!
```
✓ D-Wave **auto-selects** appropriate Lagrange multiplier
✓ Uses **adaptive penalties** during solving
✓ Solutions are **FEASIBLE**
✗ Slower (65.7s) because D-Wave is more conservative

### PATCH Approach (WRONG)
```python
# comprehensive_benchmark.py line 565
lagrange_multiplier = 10000 * max_obj_coeff  
bqm, invert = cqm_to_bqm(cqm, lagrange_multiplier=lagrange_multiplier)
```
✗ **Manually specified** Lagrange multiplier
✗ **Fixed penalty** (no adaptation)
✗ Solutions are **INFEASIBLE** (massive violations)
✓ Much faster (2.99-3.73s) because solver ignores constraints

## Why Manual Lagrange Fails

When you manually set `lagrange_multiplier`:
1. D-Wave uses **fixed penalties** throughout solving
2. No **adaptive reweighting** to enforce constraints
3. Solver can get stuck in **infeasible local minima**
4. It finds "solutions" quickly by **violating constraints**

When D-Wave auto-selects:
1. Analyzes **constraint structure**
2. Computes **appropriate penalty weights**
3. Uses **adaptive penalties** during hybrid solving
4. **Reweights and retries** if constraints are violated
5. Takes longer but ensures **feasibility**

## The Fix

**Remove manual Lagrange multiplier from PATCH** - use auto-selection like BQUBO:

```python
# BEFORE (comprehensive_benchmark.py):
lagrange_multiplier = 10000 * max_obj_coeff
bqm, invert = cqm_to_bqm(cqm, lagrange_multiplier=lagrange_multiplier)

# AFTER (FIXED):
bqm, invert = cqm_to_bqm(cqm)  # Let D-Wave choose!
```

## Expected Results After Fix

**PATCH with auto Lagrange**:
- hybrid_time: ~30-60s (slower than 3s, still comparable to BQUBO's 65s)
- is_feasible: **true**
- n_violations: **0**
- Better solution quality

## Why BQUBO Was Slower

NOT because of:
- ✗ More constraints (BQUBO actually has FEWER)
- ✗ Larger BQM (BQUBO has smaller BQM)
- ✗ Worse formulation

BUT because of:
- ✓ **D-Wave being MORE CAREFUL** with auto Lagrange
- ✓ **Ensuring feasibility** (which PATCH wasn't doing)
- ✓ **Adaptive penalty mechanism** taking time to converge

## Summary

**Your observation was 100% correct**: PATCH was much faster than BQUBO.

**The reason**: PATCH was producing **infeasible garbage solutions** fast, while BQUBO was carefully finding **feasible solutions** slowly.

**The solution**: Use D-Wave's auto Lagrange multiplier in PATCH (now fixed in `comprehensive_benchmark.py`)

## Files Modified

1. **`comprehensive_benchmark.py`**: Removed manual Lagrange multiplier calculation, now uses `cqm_to_bqm(cqm)` without parameters

## Next Steps

Re-run the PATCH BQM benchmarks with the fix:
```bash
python comprehensive_benchmark.py --configs
```

You should now see:
- PATCH hybrid times: ~30-60s (slower than before, but feasible)
- n_violations: 0 (all constraints satisfied)
- Similar performance to BQUBO (both using auto Lagrange)
