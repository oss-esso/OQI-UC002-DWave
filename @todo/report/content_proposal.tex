\begin{abstract}

 Nutrition and the environment are inextricably linked. Climate change adversely affects yields and nutritional quality of major staple crops, raising the risk of food insecurity and malnutrition. Conversely, our food systems drive an estimated 80\% of deforestation and a third of greenhouse gas emissions. As populations and incomes grow in developing countries, demand for animal-source foods will rise, placing further pressure on meeting climate and biodiversity loss goals. \cite{Fanzo2022, UNFSS_Planet_2023, Sylvester2024}

With the rapid progress in quantum computing, various optimization tasks in industry, energy, and other societal applications may take advantage of these novel methodological opportunities \cite{ajagekar_quantum_2019,abbas_quantum_2023,osaba_hybrid_2024}.

To this purpose, a set of well established ways to convert Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) optimization problems into Quadratic Binary Unconstrained Optimization (QUBO) problems -- those that are naturally handled by quantum computers and annealers -- is now available \cite{naghmouchi_mixed_2024,franco_efficient_2023,karimi_practical_2019}.

Our goal is to demonstrate the usage of such methods in the resolution of a food optimization problem, showing how they constitute a valid alternative to classical solvers in predefined instances.\cite{karimi_practical_2019,ajagekar_quantum_2020,ajagekar_quantum_2021,chang_hybrid_2022,wang_quantum-inspired_2022,yonaga_quantum_2022,franco_efficient_2023,paterakis_hybrid_2023,ellinas_hybrid_2024,naghmouchi_mixed_2024}.

\section{Description of the problem and its societal context}

The global food system faces mounting pressure to provide nutritious, affordable, and environmentally sustainable food. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global hunger has risen to 9.2\% of the world population in 2022, compared with 7.9\% in 2019 \cite{FAO_hunger}. Conflict and insecurity, economic shocks, and extreme weather events are the main drivers of acute food insecurity. Current food systems are characterized by significant limitations that contribute to the triple burden of malnutrition: undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight/obesity. Research indicates that 88\% of countries experience the coexistence of multiple burdens of malnutrition, often associated with diets high in saturated fat, sugar, and processed foods while being low in fiber, fruits, and vegetables \cite{ZOU2022100624}.

Food systems are complex networks of activities, actors, resources, and environments encompassing the production, processing, distribution, consumption, and disposal of food products. Comprehending these networks is arduous as they are constantly evolving, and are interconnected with broader social, economic and policy systems. To achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 \cite{UN_SDG2}, the FAO affirms that a better understanding of food systems requires a local-to-global perspective.

Climate change has a very strong impact on food systems, exacerbating hunger and malnutrition issues, especially in regions that are already vulnerable. It triggers extreme weather events, the emergence and spread of pests and diseases, and it compromises the adaptation of traditionally grown foods, resulting in reduced crop yields \cite{IPCC_food_security}. Current projections indicate a necessary increase of food production per hectare by almost 60 percent by 2050 to meet the needs of the projected global population of 10 billion—assuming a static agricultural land \cite{GESDA_radar}. In this context, increasing productivity of agricultural land is not sufficient to address the core human need for food. Even now, in countries with low and middle incomes, diets are known to be lacking in micro-nutrients including iron, zinc, folate, vitamin A, calcium, and vitamin B12. As populations continue to grow, innovative solutions are much needed to devise sustainable agricultural practices that provide for more nutritious diets, while respecting planetary boundaries.

On the other hand, food systems also contribute significantly to climate change, accounting for 34\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While the production of food is a large contributor, greenhouse gas emissions associated with food transport also keep increasing \cite{Pradhan2022}. Both the UNFCCC and the FAO are working not only towards climate-resilient and low-emission agricultural practices, but also acknowledge the considerable potential to maximize co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation of global food supply chains \cite{FAO_climate_strategy}.

Recent large-scale disruptions like the Panama Canal drought have reinforced awareness of the vulnerability of the global food supply chains \cite{Nelson2021}, in critical chokepoints represented by maritime corridors such as straits and canals, and coastal and inland transport infrastructures in major crop importing-exporting regions. Accurate modelling of food systems will help provide the basis for improving our ability to produce nutritious food sustainably and foster resilience and respond to unforeseeable food systems disruptions.

Key challenges include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensuring food security and nutritional adequacy for growing populations
    \item Reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture
    \item Balancing economic viability for producers with affordability for consumers
    \item Promoting diversity in crop production to enhance resilience and health outcomes
    \item Addressing the fundamental issue that healthy diets remain unaffordable for many populations
    \item Improving the resilience of global food supply chains against potential disruptions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Who is affected:} Both local and global populations are impacted, with particular vulnerability among low-income communities and regions with limited arable land. 

\textbf{Geographies and demographics:} The affected populations are widespread, but the solution depends on the chosen region, types of crops, and local producer profiles. By 2050, 68\% of the world's population will live in urban regions, consuming 80\% of total food production while cities occupy only 3\% of Earth's surface \cite{ZOU2022100624}. Climate change will further exacerbate these challenges, with 70\% of studies indicating crop yield declines by the 2030s \cite{ZOU2022100624}.

\textbf{Criticality and risks:} Risks include persistent malnutrition, unsustainable land use, and economic disparities. When we consider crop planning that is coordinated across the entire supply chain, we face a fundamental optimization challenge: given a fixed amount of farms and arable land, how can we best allocate these resources to feed the maximum number of people in a nutritionally intelligent way, at the lowest cost to the population, while minimizing environmental harm?


\section{Description of the computational challenges}

\subsection{Mathematical formulation of the problem}
We address the problem of centralized planning of sustainable food production in a pre-established area. To this end, we take a smaller instance of the problem presented in \cite{esteso_sustainable_2023} and we model it as a multi-objective optimization problem.
The subset contains the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
    \item maximize nutritional value
    \item maximize nutrient density
    \item maximize affordability
    \item minimize environmental impact
\end{itemize}
Our objective can in a first approximation be expressed as:
\begin{align}
    &Z = w_1G_1 + w_2 G_2 + \dots \\
    \text{subject to } &\text{Area, Crops}
    \label{eq:generalized objective}
\end{align}
where $G_i$ are the goals above and $w_i$ are the weights we associate to them.

To solve this multi-objective formulation, we transform it into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) \cite{Dantzig1951}, a well-studied class of optimization problems solved efficiently by state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi \cite{gurobi2023}, as demonstrated in \cite{esteso_sustainable_2023}.

Each goal $G_i$ is formulated as a linear combination of decision variables, weighted according to stakeholder preferences or policy priorities. The constraints encode physical limitations (available land area), agronomic requirements (minimum planting areas, crop compatibility), nutritional targets (food group diversity, dietary adequacy), and environmental bounds (emissions thresholds, resource limits). The parameters that define these constraints—including nutritional scores, environmental impacts, land availability, and dietary requirements—are derived from established databases and nutritional guidelines, ensuring the model reflects real-world agricultural and nutritional considerations.

\paragraph{Decision Variables}
Let $A_{f,c}$ denote the area—in hectares—assigned to food $c$ on farm $f$, whether it is a crop or an animal.
Introduce auxiliary binary variables $Y_{f,c}$, where:
\begin{equation}
Y_{f,c} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if food $c$ is planted at farm $f$,}\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
Additionally, introduce global binary variables $U_c$ to track unique food selection across all farms:
\begin{equation}
U_c = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if food $c$ is planted on at least one farm,}\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The variables $U_c$ are essential for correctly enforcing food group diversity constraints, which require counting the number of \textit{distinct} foods selected rather than the total number of plot-crop assignments.
With this formulation the problem is now expressed as a MILP: the area $A_{f,c} \in [0, A_{max}]$\footnote{The minimum area here is set to 0 as it is the lowest bound when not planted, but the interval could also be expressed as the disjoint $\{0\}\cup[A_{c, min}, A_{max}]$ if the minimum area is relevant—for example when considering to build shelter for animals} is now expressed through the combination of a (semi)continuous variable $A_{f,c} \in [-\infty, A_{max}]$ and a binary variable $Y_{f,c}$. 

\paragraph{Parameters}
To provide a model that is as close as possible to real-world scenarios, the following parameters will be used to characterize our data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nutritional value score for food $c$ (higher is better).
    \item Nutrient density score for food $c$ (higher is better).
    \item Environmental impact score for food $c$ (lower is better).
    \item Affordability score for food $c$ (higher is better).
    \item Total land available at farm $f$.
    \item Minimum area to be planted for food $c$ (if selected).
    \item Set of foods belonging to food group $g$.
    \item Minimum and maximum number of foods to produce per food group $g$, following from dietary constraints.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Classical computational approaches \cite{CLAUTIAUX2025707}}
\label{sub:classical}

\input{diagram_hardness}


Classical MILP solvers have achieved remarkable sophistication through the systematic integration of several foundational algorithmic components, such as branch-and-bound methodology, cutting-plane techniques (branch-and-cut), column generation (branch-and-price), primal heuristic strategies \cite{reference missing}. The branch-and-bound algorithm forms the cornerstone of modern MILP solvers, employing a recursive partitioning strategy that systematically explores the integer feasible region through variable fixation and continuous LP relaxations at each node of the enumeration tree \cite{achterberg2007constraint, wolsey1998integer}. The algorithm's efficiency derives from its pruning mechanism, whereby nodes with relaxation bounds that cannot improve upon the current incumbent solution are eliminated, thereby substantially reducing the computational search space.



Leading commercial implementations, include IBM CPLEX and Gurobi Optimizer \cite{cplex2023, gurobi2023}.

Despite their remarkable sophistication, classical MILP solvers face several fundamental bottlenecks that can significantly limit their performance and scalability across diverse problem classes:

\begin{itemize}


\item LP relaxation tightness represents a primary concern, as weak relaxations with large integrality gaps force the branch-and-bound algorithm to explore extensive enumeration trees before effective pruning can occur~\cite{nemhauser1999integer}.

\item While cutting-plane methods can strengthen these relaxations, the computational overhead of cut generation - including the solution of auxiliary linear programs and execution of combinatorial separation algorithms - can itself become prohibitively expensive, particularly when yielding diminishing marginal improvements~\cite{mitchell2002cutting}.

\item Branch-and-bound tree explosion constitutes another critical limitation, where suboptimal variable selection and node selection heuristics may cause exponential growth in the number of subproblems, consuming substantial computational memory and potentially exhausting available system resources before optimal solutions are identified~\cite{linderoth2005anatomy}.

\item In column generation frameworks (branch-and-price), the decomposition of large-scale MILPs into master problems and pricing subproblems introduces iterative solution procedures that can themselves constitute computationally intensive linear or mixed-integer programs, with convergence potentially stalling when pricing subproblems prove difficult or generate only marginally beneficial columns~\cite{lubbecke2005selected}.

\item Primal heuristic strategies, while effective at rapidly identifying feasible solutions, may become trapped in suboptimal regions of the solution space, and the development of problem-specific heuristic procedures requires substantial domain expertise that cannot always be automated effectively~\cite{berthold2013heuristic}.

\item Numerical stability issues arising from ill-conditioned constraint matrices necessitate frequent basis refactorizations in LP solution procedures, while aggressive preprocessing strategies may inadvertently eliminate structural properties essential for specialized cutting-plane generation or decomposition approaches~\cite{gamrath2015structure}.

\item Finally, parallel scalability remains constrained by synchronization overhead and load-balancing challenges across multiple computational threads, particularly in the presence of intensive cut generation or complex heuristic procedures~\cite{shinano2018parallelization}. 

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description of the potential quantum computing solution}\label{PoC}

The optimization model of interest (e.g.\ \cite{esteso_sustainable_2023}) is typically posed as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP): linear cost terms subject to hard inequality constraints. Industrial MILP solvers such as Gurobi exploit the linear structure and the combinatorial structure of integer variables to produce effective exact and heuristic methods. However, many physically- and quantum-inspired methods operate natively on unconstrained, often nonlinear cost landscapes - most notably the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, which is equivalent to a classical interacting-spin model.

Converting a MILP into QUBO usually proceeds in two steps: (1) represent real-valued variables by binary arrays up to some chosen precision, and (2) turn constraints into soft quadratic penalty terms \cite{wang_quantum-inspired_2022}. That conversion is convenient for annealers and Ising-type machines, but it typically destroys the original problem structure that MILP solvers exploit.

This loss of structure matters because both MILP and QUBO formulations are NP-hard in general \cite{FBarahona_1982}; no polynomial-time algorithm can guarantee optimality (or a bounded approximation ratio) in the worst case; generic algorithms perform evenly across a class of problems, and only by exploiting structure can one expect systematic gains \cite{NFL,ronnow2014defining}. In practice, then, a straightforward conversion of a carefully structured MILP into a penalized QUBO often yields instances on which classical solvers perform poorly - not because the solvers are weak in general, but because the conversion removed exploitable structure and altered the problem’s landscape.

That observation motivates the search for cases where quantum or quantum-inspired devices do have an advantage. Several studies show that when a problem or a portion of it maps to a QUBO with features favourable to annealing (for example sparse interactions, locally hard substructures, or instances that admit advantageous minor embeddings) quantum algorithms can outperform a given classical algorithm on the QUBO formulation \cite{ajagekar_quantum_2019,ajagekar_quantum_2020,abbas_quantum_2023}.

Still, the literature is cautious: demonstrations to date document potential or limited quantum advantage rather than a general, hardware-agnostic breakthrough \cite{hoefler2023disentanglinghypepracticalityrealistically,ronnow2014defining}. The distinction is important and operational: we define potential quantum advantage as a speedup relative to a specific classical algorithm or set of classical algorithms, and limited quantum advantage as a speedup relative to classical algorithms that implement the same algorithmic approach on classical hardware.

Practical benchmarking also exposes important caveats. Embedding overheads - the cost of mapping problem graphs to the sparse connectivity of current QPUs - are significant and can dominate runtimes, constraining effective problem size and eroding any raw speedup from the QPU itself \cite{ReinholdssonOdelius2023,naghmouchi_mixed_2024}. On the other hand, hybrid quantum–classical strategies - where a classical decomposition exposes structure and a quantum component tackles the hard subproblems - appear especially promising; they leverage classical pre/post-processing to preserve exploitable structure while using quantum resources where they are most likely to help \cite{franco_efficient_2023,VallejoBenitezCano2021}.

Taken together, these points argue for a cautious, structure-aware approach. Rather than expecting a blanket advantage, one should look for the structural components of an application that are classically challenging and naturally expressed as QUBO subproblems; those are the places where potential or limited quantum advantage may realistically appear \cite{ajagekar_quantum_2020,ronnow2014defining}. For domain problems such as food production - where bottlenecks are combinatorial, high-dimensional, and time-sensitive - hybrid quantum-classical pipelines can therefore represent a research-driven opportunity: they may accelerate decision-making and reduce decomposition costs in ways that pure classical solvers cannot, provided embedding and modeling overheads are managed appropriately

Our Proof of Concept consists of two main components: \textbf{scenarios} and \textbf{solvers}.

The solvers are structured as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Classical Solvers\begin{itemize}
        \item Linear problems are modeled via PuLP, which offers - among others - these two solvers:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Gurobi \cite{gurobi2023}
            \item CPLEX \cite{cplex2023} (used as fallback)
        \end{itemize}
        \item Non Linear problems are modeled via Pyomo \cite{bynum2021pyomo}, which offers - among other solvers:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Gurobi \cite{gurobi2023}
            \item SCIP \cite{BolusaniEtal2024OO} (used as fallback)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \begin{itemize}
        \item Quantum Solvers
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dwave Leap Hybrid Solver \cite{DwaveLeapHybrid} which - among others - contains:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item LeapHybridCQMSampler for Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) solver
                \item LeapHybridBQMSampler for Binary Quadratic Model (CQM) solver, which is used to solve the QUBO form of the problems
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Scenarios on the other hand were created with the following procedure:

\paragraph{Crops:}

The data were provided by GAIN \cite{GAIN} in three different datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \path{LCA results per kg & NVS.xlsx}
    \item \path{NVS_12Apr2024.xlsx}
    \item \path{PricePer100NVS_Indonesia_3Sept2024.xlsx}
\end{itemize}


The values were processed as follows to obtain normalized scores:  

\begin{itemize}
\item 
    \begin{equation}
       \text{Nut. Score}=\frac{\text{nutritional\_score}}{\max(\text{nutrient\_density})}
    \end{equation}
\item 
    \begin{equation}
       \text{Nut. Density}=\frac{\text{nutritional\_score}}{\max(\text{nutrient\_density})}
    \end{equation}
    \item 
    \begin{equation}
       \text{Env. Impact}=\left(\frac{\text{NVS}}{100}\times\frac{\text{Primary\_production\_mPt\_100NVS}}{\max(\text{Primary\_production\_mPt\_100NVS})}\right)
    \end{equation}
    \item 
    \begin{equation}
       \text{Sustainability}=\left(\frac{\text{NVS}}{100}\times\frac{\text{TOTAL\_categories\_mPt\_100NVS}}{\max(\text{TOTAL\_categories\_mPt\_100NVS})}\right)^{-1}
    \end{equation}
    \item
    \begin{equation}
       \text{Affordability}=\left(\frac{\text{NVS}}{100}\times\frac{\text{Cost to achieve NVS score of 100}}{\max(\text{Cost to achieve NVS score of 100})}\right)^{-1}
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}


To create a comprehensive dataset, the same food was found in all three files (manually due to different naming conventions) and added to a separate dataset with the normalized scores. Then all rows containing empty values were discarded and the columns aggregated.

The aggregation is due to the fact that these datasets are not representative of a single geographic area, and don't represent a detailed enough dataset when considered singularly.

The data for the complete scenario is represented below:

\subsection{Benchmarking strategy}

\subsubsection{Scenario Adaptation}


Due to how the model is  formulated, the total area is a parameter known \textit{a priori}; this total area is going to get subdivided either into a number of farms with uneven area, or into a number of uniformly sized plots.

Additional information regarding the difference between the two choices can be found in the appendix \ref{sec:appx}.

\subsubsection{Overview}
The benchmark will be comprehensive of two formulations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Binary Formulation} (Even Grid): Used when land is divided into equal-sized plots
    \item \textbf{Continuous Formulation} (Uneven Distribution): Used when farms have varying sizes
\end{enumerate}

We aim to solve the optimization problem using three different methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PuLP with Gurobi solver (classical optimization)
    \item D-Wave Hybrid CQM Solver (quantum-classical hybrid)
    \item D-Wave Hybrid BQM Solver (quantum-enabled via CQM $\to$BQM conversion)
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Objective Functions}

\paragraph{Continuous Formulation Objective}

The objective function maximizes the weighted sum of agricultural value metrics, normalized by total available land:

$$\max \quad Z = \frac{1}{\sum_{f \in F} L_f} \sum_{f \in F} \sum_{c \in C} B_c \cdot A_{f,c}$$

where the composite value $B_c$ for crop $c$ is defined as:

$$B_c = w_{nv} \cdot v_{nv,c} + w_{nd} \cdot v_{nd,c} - w_{ei} \cdot v_{ei,c} + w_{af} \cdot v_{af,c} + w_{su} \cdot v_{su,c}$$

\textbf{Note:} This is equivalent to \ref{eq:linear_obj} after appropriate renormalization.

\paragraph{Binary Formulation Objective}

For the binary formulation, the objective accounts for the fixed area $a_p$ of each plot:

$$\max \quad Z = \frac{1}{\sum_{p \in F} a_p} \sum_{p \in F} \sum_{c \in C} a_p \cdot B_c \cdot Y_{p,c}$$

where $B_c$ is defined identically as in the continuous formulation.

\textbf{Interpretation:} Each selected assignment contributes the plot's area multiplied by the crop's value density.

\subsubsection{Constraints}

\paragraph{Continuous Formulation Constraints}

\subparagraph{Land Availability Constraints}

Each farm cannot allocate more land than available:

$$\sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} A_{f,c} \leq L_f \quad \forall f \in \mathcal{F}$$

\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Land\_Availability\_\{farm\}}

\subparagraph{Minimum Planting Area Constraints}

If a crop is selected on a farm, it must occupy at least the minimum required area:

$$A_{f,c} \geq A_{min,c} \cdot Y_{f,c} \quad \forall f \in \mathcal{F}, c \in C$$


\textbf{Logical Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $Y_{f,c} = 1$: $A_{f,c} \geq A_{min,c}$ (enforces minimum area)
    \item If $Y_{f,c} = 0$: $A_{f,c} \geq 0$ (no planting, so area can be zero)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Min\_Area\_If\_Selected\_\{farm\}\_\{crop\}}

\subparagraph{Maximum Planting Area Constraints}

If a crop is not selected, its allocated area must be zero:

$$A_{f,c} \leq L_f \cdot Y_{f,c} \quad \forall f \in \mathcal{F}, c \in C$$


\textbf{Logical Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item If $Y_{f,c} = 1$: $A_{f,c} \leq L_f$ (area can be up to farm size)
    \item If $Y_{f,c} = 0$: $A_{f,c} \leq 0$ (forces area to zero)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Max\_Area\_If\_Selected\_\{farm\}\_\{crop\}}

\subparagraph{Food Group Minimum Constraints}

At least a minimum number of \textit{unique} crops from specified food groups must be cultivated. Using the $U_c$ variables:

$$\sum_{c \in \mathcal{G}_g} U_c \geq N_{min,g} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G} \text{ where } N_{min,g} \text{ is defined}$$

\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Food\_Group\_Min\_\{group\}}

\subparagraph{Food Group Maximum Constraints}

A maximum number of \textit{unique} crops from specified food groups must not be exceeded:

$$\sum_{c \in \mathcal{G}_g} U_c \leq N_{max,g} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G} \text{ where } N_{max,g} \text{ is defined}$$

\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Food\_Group\_Max\_\{group\}}

\subparagraph{$U$-$Y$ Linking Constraints}

The $U_c$ variables must be properly linked to the $Y_{f,c}$ variables:

\begin{align}
Y_{f,c} &\leq U_c \quad \forall f \in \mathcal{F}, c \in \mathcal{C} \label{eq:u_link_upper}\\
U_c &\leq \sum_{f \in \mathcal{F}} Y_{f,c} \quad \forall c \in \mathcal{C} \label{eq:u_link_lower}
\end{align}

\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Eq.~\eqref{eq:u_link_upper}: If any $Y_{f,c} = 1$, then $U_c$ must be 1
    \item Eq.~\eqref{eq:u_link_lower}: If no farm selects crop $c$ (all $Y_{f,c} = 0$), then $U_c$ must be 0
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Labels:} \texttt{U\_Link\_\{farm\}\_\{crop\}}, \texttt{U\_Bound\_\{crop\}}

\paragraph{Binary Formulation Constraints}

\subparagraph{Plot Assignment Constraints}

Each plot can be assigned to at most one crop (or remain idle):

$$\sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} Y_{p,c} \leq 1 \quad \forall p \in \mathcal{F}$$



\textbf{Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\sum_{c \in C} Y_{p,c} = 0$: Plot remains idle
    \item $\sum_{c \in C} Y_{p,c} = 1$: Plot is assigned to exactly one crop
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Max\_Assignment\_\{plot\}}

\subparagraph{Minimum Plots Per Crop Constraints}

For crops with minimum planting area requirements, the constraint is converted to a minimum number of plots:

$$\sum_{p \in \mathcal{F}} Y_{p,c} \geq \left\lceil \frac{A_{min,c}}{a_p} \right\rceil \quad \forall p \in \mathcal{F} \text{ where } A_{min,c} > 0$$

where $a_p$ is the area of each plot (assumed equal in even grid).



\textbf{Interpretation:} If a crop $c$ requires minimum area $A_{min,c}$, it must be planted on at least $\lceil A_{min,c} / a_p \rceil$ plots.

\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Min\_Plots\_\{crop\}}

\subparagraph{Maximum Plots Per Crop Constraints}

For crops with maximum planting area limits, the constraint is converted to a maximum number of plots:

$$\sum_{p \in \mathcal{F}} Y_{p,c} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{A_{max,c}}{a_p} \right\rfloor \quad \forall c \in \mathcal{C} \text{ where } A_{max,c} \text{ is defined}$$



\textbf{Interpretation:} If a crop $c$ has maximum area $A_{max,c}$, it can be planted on at most $\lfloor A_{max,c} / a_p \rfloor$ plots.


\textbf{Label:} \texttt{Max\_Plots\_\{crop\}}




\subparagraph{Food Group Constraints}

The food group constraints use the $U_c$ variables to count \textit{unique} foods selected:

$$\sum_{c \in \mathcal{G}_g} U_c \geq N_{min,g} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}$$
$$\sum_{c \in \mathcal{G}_g} U_c \leq N_{max,g} \quad \forall g \in \mathcal{G}$$

\subparagraph{$U$-$Y$ Linking Constraints}

The linking constraints ensure $U_c = 1$ if and only if crop $c$ is selected on at least one plot:

\begin{align}
Y_{p,c} &\leq U_c \quad \forall p \in \mathcal{F}, c \in \mathcal{C}\\
U_c &\leq \sum_{p \in \mathcal{F}} Y_{p,c} \quad \forall c \in \mathcal{C}
\end{align}

\textbf{Labels:} \texttt{MinFoodGroup\_Unique\_\{group\}}, \texttt{MaxFoodGroup\_Unique\_\{group\}}, \texttt{U\_Link\_\{plot\}\_\{crop\}}, \texttt{U\_Bound\_\{crop\}}

\subsection{Resource estimation}

Resource estimation for quantum annealing applications differs fundamentally from gate-based quantum computing. Rather than circuit depth and gate counts, the relevant metrics center on problem embedding, qubit utilization, annealing time, and classical preprocessing overhead. This section provides comprehensive resource estimates for our crop allocation optimization across multiple problem scales and solution architectures.

\subsubsection{Problem Scaling and Variable Requirements}

The number of binary decision variables scales with the product of farms (or patches) and crops. For the binary crop allocation formulation (Variant A), the total variable count is:
\begin{equation}
N_{\text{vars}} = |\mathcal{F}| \times |\mathcal{C}| + |\mathcal{C}|
\end{equation}
where the first term represents farm-crop assignment variables $Y_{f,c}$ and the second term accounts for global crop selection indicators $U_c$. For our benchmark configuration with 27 crops, this yields approximately $27|\mathcal{F}| + 27$ variables.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Problem scaling characteristics across benchmark configurations}
\label{tab:problem_scaling}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Configuration} & \textbf{Farms} & \textbf{Crops} & \textbf{Variables} & \textbf{Constraints} & \textbf{Density} \\
\midrule
Validation & 10 & 27 & 297 & $\sim$120 & 0.15 \\
Small-scale & 50 & 27 & 1,377 & $\sim$350 & 0.08 \\
Medium-scale & 200 & 27 & 5,427 & $\sim$950 & 0.04 \\
Large-scale & 1,000 & 27 & 27,027 & $\sim$3,500 & 0.02 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The constraint density decreases with problem size because the number of global constraints (food group diversity, crop area bounds) remains fixed while farm-level constraints scale linearly. This sparsity pattern is favorable for quantum annealing, as it limits the connectivity requirements in the embedded problem graph.

\subsubsection{Quantum Hardware Requirements}

\paragraph{D-Wave Advantage System Specifications}

Our target platform is the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer, featuring 5,760 qubits in a Pegasus P16 topology with average connectivity of 15 neighbors per qubit. The Pegasus architecture supports native cliques of 15--20 fully connected qubits without chain overhead, enabling efficient embedding of moderately dense subproblems.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{QPU resource utilization estimates}
\label{tab:qpu_resources}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Problem Size} & \textbf{Logical Qubits} & \textbf{Physical Qubits} & \textbf{Chain Length} \\
\midrule
$\leq$50 vars & 50 & 80--150 & 1.2--1.8 \\
50--200 vars & 200 & 400--800 & 1.5--2.5  \\
200--500 vars & 500 & 1,200--2,500 & 2.0--4.0  \\
500--1,000 vars & 1,000 & 3,000--5,500 & 3.0--6.0  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The chain length column indicates the average number of physical qubits required to represent each logical variable after minor embedding. Chain breaks occur when physical qubits within a chain disagree, directly impacting solution quality. Our empirical tests show chain break rates consistently below 2\% with auto-scaled chain strength, validating that the Pegasus topology accommodates our problem structure effectively.

% \paragraph{Annealing Time and Sample Requirements}

% Pure QPU annealing time scales favorably with problem size:
% \begin{equation}
% T_{\text{QPU}} \approx N_{\text{reads}} \times (t_{\text{anneal}} + t_{\text{readout}})
% \end{equation}
% where $t_{\text{anneal}} \in [20, 200]\,\mu s$ is the programmable annealing time and $t_{\text{readout}} \approx 100\,\mu s$ is the measurement overhead. For 100--500 reads per subproblem, total QPU access time remains under 100 ms even for large instances.

% \begin{table}[H]
% \centering
% \caption{Runtime estimates by solution architecture}
% \label{tab:runtime_estimates}
% \begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
% \toprule
% \textbf{Problem Size} & \textbf{Pure QPU} & \textbf{Hybrid Solver} & \textbf{Classical (Gurobi)} \\
% \midrule
% Small ($\leq$50 vars) & 2--100 ms & 10--60 s & $<$0.1 s \\
% Medium (50--200 vars) & 10--200 ms & 30--180 s & 0.1--1 s \\
% Large (200--500 vars) & 20--500 ms & 60--600 s & 1--10 s \\
% Very Large (500+ vars) & 50--1,000 ms & 300--3,600 s & 10--300 s \\
% \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% The apparent paradox - QPU times orders of magnitude faster than hybrid or classical solvers - reflects that pure QPU time excludes embedding overhead and post-processing. Total wall-clock time for QPU-based solutions is dominated by classical preprocessing (embedding computation: 95--99\% of runtime) rather than quantum annealing itself \cite{reinholdsson2023embedding, mcgeoch2020dwave}.

\subsubsection{Empirical Simulated Annealing Benchmarks}

To ground our resource estimates in empirical data, we conducted simulated annealing (SA) experiments on both problem formulations using D-Wave's Ocean SDK (\texttt{SimulatedAnnealingSampler}) \cite{dwave_ocean} on a standard workstation (Intel i7-12700H, 16 GB RAM). Table~\ref{tab:sa_empirical} presents timing results across problem scales for the two formulations introduced in Section~\ref{sub:classical}.

\paragraph{BP (Binary Patch) Formulation}

The BP formulation uses pure binary variables $Y_{p,c} \in \{0,1\}$ and $U_c \in \{0,1\}$, making it directly compatible with QUBO/quantum annealing \cite{lucas2014ising, glover2018tutorial}. Total variables scale as $n_{\text{patches}} \times n_{\text{foods}} + n_{\text{foods}}$.

\paragraph{MIP (Farm-level) Formulation with Discretization}

The original MIP formulation with continuous area variables $A_{f,c}$ cannot be directly solved by SA. To enable QUBO conversion, we discretize areas into $k$ binary levels \cite{chancellor2019domain}: $$A_{f,c} \approx \sum_{l=1}^{k} (L_f/k) \cdot a_{f,c,l} \quad\text{ where }a_{f,c,l} \in \{0,1\}$$. This significantly increases variable count to $n_{\text{farms}} \times n_{\text{foods}} \times k + n_{\text{farms}} \times n_{\text{foods}} + n_{\text{foods}}$.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Empirical SA runtime measurements (100 reads, 1000 sweeps)}
\label{tab:sa_empirical}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Formulation} & \textbf{Scale} & \textbf{Variables} & \textbf{Interactions} & \textbf{SA Time (s)} & \textbf{ms/var} \\
\midrule
\multirow{6}{*}{BP (Binary Patch)} 
 & 3 patches & 108 & 1,134 & 0.18 & 1.67 \\
 & 10 patches & 297 & 3,780 & 0.58 & 1.95 \\

 & 370 patches & 10,017 & 139,860 & 21.88 & 2.18 \\
 & 1,170 patches & 31,617 & 442,260 & 87.85 & 2.78 \\
\midrule
\multirow{4}{*}{MIP (4-level discretization)} 
 & 3 farms & 432 & 17,739 & 1.15 & 2.65 \\
 & 10 farms & 1,377 & 59,130 & 3.75 & 2.72 \\
 & 25 farms & 3,402 & 147,825 & 11.07 & 3.25 \\
 & 50 farms & 6,777 & 295,650 & 26.21 & 3.87 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Scaling Analysis}

Fitting power-law models $T = \alpha \cdot n^\beta$ to the empirical data yields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BP formulation:} $T \approx 0.0012 \cdot n^{1.07}$ (nearly linear scaling)
    \item \textbf{MIP discretized:} $T \approx 0.0011 \cdot n^{1.14}$ (slightly super-linear due to denser interactions)
\end{itemize}

The BP formulation is more efficient per variable because it avoids the additional linking constraints required to enforce discretized area consistency. This demonstrates why the BP formulation is preferred for QUBO conversion: it produces smaller, sparser problems while preserving the essential optimization structure.

\paragraph{Comparison with Gurobi}

For context, Gurobi solves the \emph{original} MIP formulation (with continuous $A_{f,c}$ variables) in under 1 second for problems up to 1,000 farms, exploiting the tight LP relaxation \cite{gurobi2023}. However, when Gurobi solves the BP formulation as a pure binary MIP, performance degrades significantly - the same problem that takes 0.1s with MIP may require 10--60s with BP due to the exponential worst-case complexity of branch-and-bound on pure binary problems without strong LP bounds \cite{wolsey1998integer, achterberg2007constraint}.

\subsubsection{Hybrid Solver Scaling from Literature}

Recent benchmarking studies provide empirical data on D-Wave hybrid solver performance for comparable QUBO/Max-Cut problems. Table~\ref{tab:hybrid_literature} summarizes key findings from Hrga et al.~\cite{hrga2024maxcut} and the KTH thesis by Reinholdsson \& Odelius~\cite{reinholdsson2023embedding}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Hybrid solver runtime characteristics from literature}
\label{tab:hybrid_literature}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Problem Size} & \textbf{Hybrid Time (s)} & \textbf{SA-Quality Time (s)} & \textbf{Speedup} \\
\midrule
800 nodes & $\sim$3.0 & $\sim$672 & 224$\times$ \\
2,000 nodes & $\sim$5.2 & $\sim$670 & 129$\times$ \\
10,000 nodes & $\sim$5.2 & $\sim$680 & 131$\times$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Key observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The hybrid solver maintains \textbf{near-constant runtime} (3--5 seconds) across problem sizes from 800 to 10,000 variables, demonstrating excellent scaling properties \cite{hrga2024maxcut}.
    \item For problems below 251 variables, both hybrid and SA consistently achieve \textbf{global optima} \cite{hrga2024maxcut}.
    \item For larger problems (G-set Max-Cut benchmarks \cite{gset_benchmarks}), hybrid solver solutions are within 1--2\% of best-known values while being 100--200$\times$ faster than quality-focused SA \cite{hrga2024maxcut}.
    \item The Toshiba Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM) provides competitive quality at similar speeds to hybrid solvers \cite{goto2019combinatorial, toshiba_sbm}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{D-Wave Hybrid Solver Minimum Time Formula}

The LeapHybridBQMSampler uses piecewise-linear minimum runtime scaling \cite{dwave_hybrid_solver}:
\begin{equation}
T_{\text{min}}(n) = \begin{cases}
3\,\text{s} & n \leq 1024 \\
3 + 0.0023(n - 1024)\,\text{s} & 1024 < n \leq 4096 \\
10 + 0.005(n - 4096)\,\text{s} & 4096 < n \leq 10000 \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

For CQM problems with constraints, the formula incorporates additional terms \cite{dwave_cqm_solver}:
\begin{equation}
T_{\text{CQM}} = 5 + 0.000157 \cdot n_{\text{vars}} + 4.66 \times 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{biases}} + 6.44 \times 10^{-9} \cdot n_{\text{constraints}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Comparative Runtime Projections}

Combining our empirical SA measurements with literature-derived hybrid scaling, we project comparative runtimes for our crop allocation problems:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Projected runtime comparison: SA vs Hybrid vs Gurobi}
\label{tab:runtime_comparison}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Problem Instance} & \textbf{Variables} & \textbf{SA (ours)} & \textbf{Hybrid (proj.)} & \textbf{Gurobi} \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\textit{BP Formulation (QUBO-native)}} \\
36 patches $\times$ 27 crops & 999 & 2.0 s & 3.0 s & 1--5 s \\
115 patches $\times$ 27 crops & 3,132 & 6.1 s & 3.0 s & 5--30 s \\
370 patches $\times$ 27 crops & 10,017 & 21.9 s & 5.2 s & 30--300 s \\
1,170 patches $\times$ 27 crops & 31,617 & 87.9 s & $\sim$8 s & timeout \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\textit{MIP Formulation (original problem, Gurobi only)}} \\
100 farms $\times$ 27 crops & $\sim$2,800 & N/A & N/A & $<$0.5 s \\
500 farms $\times$ 27 crops & $\sim$14,000 & N/A & N/A & $<$1.0 s \\
1,000 farms $\times$ 27 crops & $\sim$28,000 & N/A & N/A & 1--5 s \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: The MIP formulation with continuous $A_{f,c}$ variables cannot be directly solved by SA or quantum annealing. Gurobi's performance on MIP is orders of magnitude better than on BP due to the tight LP relaxation.



\subsubsection{Energy Consumption Estimates (why not?)}

\paragraph{Quantum Annealing Energy Profile}

D-Wave systems operate at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$15 mK), requiring continuous refrigeration \cite{johnson2011quantum}. The Advantage system consumes approximately 25 kW of power \cite{dwave_sustainability, fellous2022limitations}, dominated by the dilution refrigerator and classical control electronics rather than the quantum processor itself.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Energy consumption estimates by implementation scenario}
\label{tab:energy_estimates}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Runtime} & \textbf{Energy (kWh)} & \textbf{CO$_2$ (kg)} \\
\midrule
PoC (100 experiments) & 5--10 hours & 125--250 & 50--100 \\
Production (daily) & 0.5--2 hours & 12.5--50 & 5--20 \\
Full-scale (weekly batch) & 10--20 hours & 250--500 & 100--200 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: CO$_2$ estimates assume 0.4 kg CO$_2$/kWh (global average grid intensity). D-Wave's cloud infrastructure may use lower-carbon energy sources.

\paragraph{Comparison with Classical Computing}

For equivalent problem sizes, classical optimization on a high-performance workstation (500 W) requires:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small problems: $<$1 second $\rightarrow$ negligible energy
    \item Large problems: 1--5 minutes $\rightarrow$ 0.004--0.04 kWh
\end{itemize}

The energy overhead of quantum annealing (due to cryogenic infrastructure) exceeds classical computing by 2--3 orders of magnitude for current problem sizes. This ratio improves for larger problems where QPU time remains nearly constant while classical time grows polynomially or exponentially.

\subsubsection{Hardware Provider}



D-Wave Leap provides the most mature quantum annealing infrastructure \cite{dwave_leap} with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantage system:} 5,760 qubits, Pegasus topology, ideal for QUBO/BQM problems \cite{boothby2020pegasus}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid solvers:} LeapHybridCQMSampler handles constrained problems up to 1 million variables \cite{dwave_hybrid_solver}
    \item \textbf{Access model:} Pay-per-use QPU time or monthly subscription plans
    \item \textbf{SDK:} Ocean toolkit with Python bindings for problem construction and embedding \cite{dwave_ocean}
\end{itemize}

}


\subsection{Local Impact Assessment}

The food production optimization solution targets multiple dimensions of sustainable development across different time horizons. The anticipated impacts span nutritional security, environmental sustainability, and economic prosperity for agricultural communities.

\subsubsection{Short-Term Impacts (0-2 years)}

\textbf{SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):} The solution delivers optimized crop planning outputs that balance nutritional value, affordability, and environmental impact. Through quantum-classical hybrid optimization, the system produces planting assignments across diversified food groups that can be implemented immediately by farming communities. This addresses SDG Target 2.3 (doubling agricultural productivity of small-scale producers) and 2.4 (ensuring sustainable food production systems).



\textbf{SDG 1 (No Poverty):} By optimizing crop selection toward higher-value, market-appropriate foods, the system enables immediate income increases for small-scale farmers. Household income surveys demonstrate measurable improvements in earnings from optimized crop sales compared to traditional planting patterns. This directly supports Target 1.2 (reducing poverty by at least half).




\textbf{SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth):} Diversified crop production creates additional employment opportunities in sustainable agriculture, from planting through harvest and post-harvest processing. Employment surveys document new labor positions generated by optimized farming operations, supporting Target 8.5 (full employment and decent work with equal pay).



\textbf{SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure):} The deployment of the digital mapping and quantum optimization platform provides stakeholders with accessible technology tools for agricultural planning, directly supporting SDG Target 9.a (facilitating sustainable infrastructure development in developing countries).



\textbf{SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities):} Platform design prioritizes accessibility for smallholder farmers, with usage metrics tracking the percentage of small-scale producers accessing quantum planning tools. This addresses Target 10.2 (promoting social inclusion of all).



\textbf{SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals):} Implementation establishes multi-stakeholder partnerships between research institutions, government agencies, NGOs, and farmer cooperatives for technology deployment. Partnership agreements and MOUs document collaboration frameworks, supporting Target 17.16 (enhanced global partnerships).



\subsubsection{Mid-Term Impacts (2-5 years)}

\textbf{SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):} Sustained implementation of optimized crop plans leads to measurable improvements in micronutrient intake. Biomarker analysis (blood/urine samples) can quantify changes in key nutrients (iron, vitamin A, zinc, folate) among participating households, addressing SDG Target 2.2 (ending all forms of malnutrition). Household Dietary Diversity Scores (HDDS) track the number of food groups consumed, demonstrating improved dietary variety.


\textbf{SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation):} Optimized crop selection favoring water-efficient species reduces total agricultural water consumption per season. Water meter readings and irrigation monitoring systems quantify improvements, addressing Target 6.4 (substantially increasing water-use efficiency).



\textbf{SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities):} Income inequality among farmers decreases as smallholders adopt optimized practices previously accessible only to larger operations. Gini coefficient calculations track changes in income distribution, supporting Target 10.1 (income growth of bottom 40\%).



\textbf{SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production):} Farms adopting sustainable production methods increase measurably. Practice surveys and certification records document implementation of environmentally-sound techniques, addressing Target 12.2 (sustainable management of natural resources).



\textbf{SDG 13 (Climate Action):} The environmental optimization component, when consistently applied, contributes to measurable reductions in CO$_2$ emissions from agricultural activities. This supports climate mitigation efforts while maintaining food security.



\textbf{SDG 15 (Life on Land):} Biodiversity on participating farmland improves through sustainable land use practices. Ecological surveys measuring species richness and abundance document ecosystem health, addressing Target 15.5 (reducing degradation and halting biodiversity loss).



\subsubsection{Long-Term Impacts (5-10 years)}

\textbf{SDG 2 (Zero Hunger):} Long-term adoption leads to improved hunger rates at community and regional scales. Household dietary recall surveys and nutritional assessments show increased percentages of households meeting minimum dietary needs. Nutritional adequacy translates to functional outcomes: adults demonstrate improved work capacity and productivity (measured through self-rating scores), while children show better school performance through improved attendance, concentration, and test scores.

\textbf{SDG 1 (No Poverty):} Poverty rates in farming communities decline measurably as sustained agricultural improvements compound over time. Economic surveys comparing household incomes to national poverty thresholds document the share of farming households moving above poverty lines, approaching Target 1.1 (eradicating extreme poverty).



\textbf{SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being):} Reduced malnutrition and improved dietary diversity lower healthcare costs at the community level through decreased incidence of nutrition-related diseases. Average monthly household healthcare expenditure declines measurably, addressing Target 3.9 (reducing deaths and illnesses from pollution and contamination). This creates a positive feedback loop with agricultural productivity.



\textbf{SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth):} Agricultural sector contribution to regional GDP increases measurably as productivity gains scale across farming communities. Economic impact assessments document the sector's enhanced role in sustainable growth, supporting Target 8.1 (sustaining per capita economic growth).



\textbf{SDG 13 (Climate Action):} Cumulative emissions reductions from optimized agricultural systems contribute to global warming mitigation efforts, with measurable impacts on regional climate resilience. GHG monitoring tools, soil tests, and energy-use records document greenhouse gas reduction per farming season, supporting Target 13.2 (integrating climate measures into policies and planning).



\textbf{SDG 15 (Life on Land):} Soil quality improves on farms using optimized agriculture, preventing land degradation. Soil testing at baseline and regular intervals measures composite indicators (organic matter, nutrients, pH), addressing Target 15.3 (combating desertification and restoring degraded land).



\subsubsection{Interlinkages}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{SDG1}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Poverty reduction enables better access to nutritious food and improved health (SDG 2, SDG 3), supports educational attainment (SDG 4), and strengthens economic participation and productivity (SDG 8).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Climate policies embedded in the optimization may increase short-term costs for poor households (SDG 13). Mitigation includes phased implementation with transition support, subsidies for sustainable inputs, social protection systems, climate-resilient livelihoods diversification, and ensuring affordability remains a weighted objective in the optimization function across all time horizons.

\item \textbf{SDG2}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Better nutrition from diversified crops improves health outcomes and reduces disease burden (SDG 3). Increased agricultural productivity through optimization reduces poverty in rural areas (SDG 1) and creates decent work opportunities (SDG 8). The optimized planning also reduces food waste and resource use (SDG 12).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Without proper environmental constraints in the optimization model, intensive agriculture may increase GHG emissions (SDG 13), strain water resources (SDG 6), and harm terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15). To mitigate these trade-offs, the optimization explicitly includes environmental impact scores from life-cycle assessments and constrains solutions to minimize land use, water consumption, and carbon footprint while maintaining nutritional adequacy.

\item \textbf{SDG3}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Better health outcomes enable improved agricultural productivity (SDG 2), better educational outcomes (SDG 4), and support economic growth through a healthier workforce (SDG 8).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Healthcare infrastructure expansion may increase energy use and emissions (SDG 13) and generate medical waste (SDG 12). Mitigation includes integrating preventive health approaches that reduce infrastructure needs, using renewable energy for health facilities, and implementing waste management systems.

\item \textbf{SDG6}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Improved water access and quality directly enhance health outcomes (SDG 3), and sustainable water management protects ecosystems (SDG 15).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Agricultural water use may compete with drinking water needs (SDG 2) in water-scarce regions. Mitigation includes: integrated water resource management, rainwater harvesting systems, drip irrigation technologies, and drought-resistant crop varieties in the optimization portfolio.

\item \textbf{SDG8}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Economic growth reduces poverty (SDG 1) and innovation infrastructure drives job creation (SDG 9).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Economic growth without environmental safeguards may increase emissions (SDG 13). The optimization explicitly constrains environmental impacts while maximizing economic value, balancing growth with sustainability. Long-term mitigation includes mainstreaming environmental safeguards in agricultural policy, carbon pricing or offset mechanisms, and demonstrating that sustainable intensification supports both growth and climate goals.

\item \textbf{SDG9}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Innovation infrastructure drives economic growth and job creation (SDG 8), enables smart planning for sustainable cities (SDG 11), and strengthens partnerships through data sharing (SDG 17).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Technology production and operation increase energy demand (SDG 13), generate electronic waste (SDG 12), and may worsen inequalities if access is uneven (SDG 10). Mitigation strategies include: using renewable energy for computing infrastructure, designing for minimal computational overhead through efficient hybrid algorithms, providing open-source tools to ensure equitable access, and incorporating training programs to bridge the digital divide.

\item \textbf{SDG10}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Reduced inequality lifts vulnerable populations (SDG 1) and fair wages support economic growth (SDG 8).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Poverty reduction efforts that rely heavily on technology adoption may inadvertently widen inequalities if access is uneven (SDG 9, SDG 10). Mitigation includes zero-cost access models, offline-capable tools, agricultural extension partnerships for technology dissemination, community facilitators bridging the digital divide, differentiated support for smaller farms, cooperative models pooling resources, and progressive pricing structures favoring disadvantaged farmers.

\item \textbf{SDG12}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Responsible consumption reduces emissions (SDG 13) and reduced waste protects ecosystems (SDG 15).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Consumption limits may slow short-term economic growth (SDG 8). Mitigation through: market development for sustainable products commanding premium prices, certification programs adding value, and demonstrating long-term economic benefits of sustainable practices.

\item \textbf{SDG13}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Climate action drives renewable energy adoption (SDG 7) and protects terrestrial (SDG 15) and marine (SDG 14) ecosystems through reduced agricultural runoff and land conversion.

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Climate policies and optimization constraints may increase costs for poor households (SDG 1), temporarily limit agricultural expansion options (SDG 2), and slow economic growth during transition (SDG 8). Mitigation requires careful policy design including gradual implementation timelines, subsidies for sustainable inputs, technical assistance for farmers, just transition frameworks ensuring equitable distribution of costs and benefits, investment in climate adaptation alongside mitigation, and continuous optimization refinement balancing affordability with environmental objectives.

\item \textbf{SDG15}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Ecosystem protection supports climate action (SDG 13) and forests regulate water cycles (SDG 6).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Land conservation may limit agricultural expansion (SDG 2) in land-scarce contexts. Mitigation includes intensification on existing farmland via optimization rather than extensification, agroforestry systems integrating conservation with production, payment for ecosystem services programs compensating farmers for conservation, landscape-level planning balancing production and conservation zones, restoration of degraded lands for agricultural use, and demonstrating that soil health improvements boost long-term productivity, aligning conservation with food security.

\item \textbf{SDG17}\par
\textbf{Positive Interlinkages:} Effective partnerships facilitate technology transfer and innovation adoption (SDG 9) and strengthen food systems through multi-stakeholder collaboration (SDG 2).

\textbf{Negative Interlinkages \& Mitigation:} Unequal partnerships may reinforce power imbalances (SDG 10). Mitigation includes: participatory governance structures, farmer representatives in decision-making bodies, transparent benefit-sharing agreements, and capacity building to equalize negotiating power.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global Transposability}

The quantum-enabled crop optimization approach is highly transposable to diverse geographical contexts, particularly in regions facing the triple burden of malnutrition, environmental degradation, and climate vulnerability.

\textbf{Target Geographies:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sub-Saharan Africa:} With 45\% of the population in rural areas and less than 10\% of health professionals serving these communities \cite{Fanzo2022}, optimized agricultural planning can address both nutritional deficiencies and economic development. Small-scale farms ($<$1 hectare) constitute approximately 45\% of farms but control only 10\% of agricultural land \cite{LOWDER201616}, making optimization critical for efficient resource utilization.

\item \textbf{South and Southeast Asia:} High population density, diverse crop systems, and significant climate risks make these regions ideal candidates. The methodology has been validated using Indonesian food data, demonstrating cultural adaptability through locally acceptable food baskets.

\item \textbf{Latin America:} Regions with high biodiversity but also significant deforestation pressures (80\% driven by food systems \cite{Fanzo2022}) would benefit from optimization that explicitly balances productivity with ecosystem conservation.

\item \textbf{Small Island Developing States (SIDS):} Limited arable land and climate vulnerability necessitate highly efficient crop planning. The optimization approach can maximize nutritional output per hectare while minimizing import dependence.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Requirements \& Feasibility:} The proof of concept requires three data categories: (1) nutritional composition and environmental impact scores (available from GAIN databases and life-cycle assessments), (2) local food preferences and prices (collectible through household surveys and market data), and (3) farm characteristics and constraints (accessible through agricultural census data or participatory mapping). These data types are increasingly available through global initiatives like the Food Systems Dashboard, making deployment feasible in most contexts with appropriate partnerships.



\subsection{SDG Interlinkages and Responsible Innovation}

The quantum optimization approach creates a complex network of SDG interlinkages that must be carefully managed to maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs \cite{Fanzo2022,UNFSS_Planet_2023,Sylvester2024}.


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Nutrition-Health-Productivity:} The primary pathway from SDG 2 $\rightarrow$ SDG 3 $\rightarrow$ SDG 8 creates reinforcing benefits. Optimizing for nutritional density directly improves health outcomes, which in turn enhances workforce productivity and agricultural capacity.

\item \textbf{Technology-Innovation-Partnership:} The quantum computing application (SDG 9) strengthens international partnerships (SDG 17) by demonstrating cutting-edge technology transfer to developing contexts while building local technical capacity. This chain enables knowledge sharing, reduces inequalities through accessible technology (SDG 10), and drives economic growth (SDG 8).

\item \textbf{Climate-Ecosystem Protection:} Environmental optimization constraints simultaneously address SDG 13 (climate action), SDG 15 (terrestrial ecosystems), SDG 6 (water management), and SDG 14 (marine ecosystems) through integrated land-use planning.



\item \textbf{Poverty-Food-Economics:} The interconnection between poverty reduction (SDG 1), food security (SDG 2), and economic growth (SDG 8) forms a mutually reinforcing triangle. Agricultural optimization addressing all three simultaneously achieves greater total impact than addressing any single goal in isolation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Critical Trade-offs Requiring Active Management:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Productivity-Environment Tension:} The fundamental trade-off between maximizing food production (SDG 2) and minimizing environmental impact (SDGs 6, 13, 14, 15) requires explicit multi-objective optimization. Sufficient analysis reveals optimal balance points where nutritional adequacy, affordability, and environmental sustainability coexist.

\item \textbf{Technology Access and Digital Divide:} While quantum optimization provides powerful capabilities (SDG 9), it risks exacerbating inequalities (SDG 10) if access is limited to well-resourced actors. Mitigation strategies include: open-source software releases, capacity-building programs, user-friendly interfaces requiring minimal technical expertise, partnerships with agricultural extension services ensuring smallholder farmer access, and community-based facilitator models bridging the digital divide.

\item \textbf{Climate Policy Costs:} Environmental optimization may increase short-term costs for implementing sustainable practices, potentially harming poor households (SDG 1) and slowing immediate economic growth (SDG 8). This trade-off requires careful balancing between climate action (SDG 13) and poverty reduction. Complementary policy interventions include: transition subsidies protecting vulnerable households, technical assistance reducing implementation costs, market development for sustainable products commanding premium prices, payments for ecosystem services compensating farmers for environmental benefits, and staged implementation allowing gradual adaptation.


% \item \textbf{Conservation-Production Balance:} Protecting biodiversity and preventing land degradation (SDG 15) may constrain agricultural expansion (SDG 2), creating tension between environmental protection and food security. Resolution requires: landscape-level planning designating conservation and production zones, sustainable intensification on existing farmland rather than extensification into natural areas, agroforestry and agroecological approaches integrating conservation with production, and demonstrating that ecosystem health supports long-term agricultural productivity.



\textbf{Monitoring and Adaptive Management:} Responsible innovation requires ongoing assessment of both intended and unintended consequences. The impact framework includes: baseline and endline surveys for all indicator measurements, participatory monitoring engaging farming communities, regular SDG interlinkage assessments using network analysis methods \cite{Fanzo2022}, and adaptive optimization that adjusts objective weights based on observed outcomes and stakeholder feedback. This ensures the solution remains aligned with holistic sustainable development goals rather than optimizing narrow metrics at the expense of broader welfare.

\subsection{Risks, Assumptions, and Key Activities}

Achieving the anticipated impacts depends on managing key risks, validating critical assumptions, and implementing essential preparatory activities.

\subsubsection{Key Risks}

Several risks could affect impact achievement across different time horizons. Income inequality between farms may persist or widen if optimization benefits apply primarily to well-resourced farmers rather than smallholders, affecting both short-term and mid-term outcomes. Lack of market access for new crops poses a significant barrier—even optimally selected crops cannot improve incomes if buyers are unavailable, particularly impacting short-term and mid-term economic gains. Regulatory barriers to new seed varieties or agricultural inputs may slow implementation at the short-term stage. 

Climate-related risks span multiple timeframes. Crops may not be resilient enough for accelerating climate change impacts, threatening both short-term and mid-term productivity gains. More acutely, severe climate shocks (droughts, floods, extreme temperatures) can dramatically reduce yields across all timeframes—short-term, mid-term, and long-term—potentially undermining the entire impact logic chain. Finally, poor quality or missing baseline data compromises the ability to measure impacts accurately in the short term, weakening evidence generation and adaptive management.

\subsubsection{Critical Assumptions}

First, local input supply chains must be able to scale to support new crop varieties—seed suppliers, fertilizer distributors, and agricultural extension services need sufficient capacity to meet changing demands. Second, buyers will purchase new nutrient-dense crops, creating market incentives for farmers to adopt optimized crop plans. Third, national regulations must permit trial of new varieties, enabling innovation while maintaining biosafety and quality standards. Fourth, farmers will accept and implement optimized crop plans if they prove profitable, assuming economic rationality drives adoption decisions. Fifth, sufficient soil and climate data are available for baseline surveys, enabling accurate optimization and impact measurement.

\subsubsection{Preparatory Activities}

Conducting baseline soil, climate, and household surveys establishes the data foundation for optimization algorithms and impact evaluation, quantifying initial conditions across agronomic, environmental, and socioeconomic dimensions. Linking producer groups with buyers and processors creates the market channels necessary for farmers to sell optimized crop outputs, addressing the market access risk proactively. Engaging regulators and documenting compliance needs ensures regulatory pathways are clear before implementation, reducing delays and enabling adaptive policy development that supports innovation while protecting public interests.

\subsection{Stakeholder Engagement}

Successful implementation requires coordinated engagement with diverse stakeholders, each playing distinct roles in the impact pathway. The Ministry of Agriculture serves as both regulator and policy architect, with primary interests in ensuring food security and regulatory compliance. As a direct stakeholder, engagement occurs through policy dialogue mechanisms, establishing regulatory frameworks that enable innovation while protecting public interests.

Farmers constitute the primary producers and direct beneficiaries of the optimization system. Their central interest—increasing yields and income while managing risk—drives adoption decisions. Direct engagement through field training programs builds capacity for using optimization tools and implementing recommended crop plans. Complementing farmer engagement, buyers and offtakers (including agricultural cooperatives, food processors, and wholesalers) require reliable supplies of nutritious crops. While indirect stakeholders, buyers are critical to closing the value chain. Market linkage activities connect optimized production with demand, ensuring farmers can sell diversified outputs profitably.

Retailers sell nutrient-dense crops to end consumers, with interests in maintaining reliable supply of diverse, high-quality produce. As direct stakeholders, retailers are engaged through market linkage strategies that align optimized crop production with retail demand patterns and quality standards. The local community represents the ultimate beneficiaries—end users of improved food systems seeking better nutrition, stable food access, and lower costs. Direct community engagement through outreach programs ensures the optimization system responds to local food preferences, affordability constraints, and cultural contexts, making nutrition improvements socially sustainable.



\end{itemize}




\section{Methods}
\label{sec:appx}

\subsection{Lagrange Multiplier Calibration Study}

\subsubsection{Motivation and Objective}

When converting a Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) to a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) via the penalty method, constraint violations are penalized using Lagrange multipliers $\lambda$. The choice of $\lambda$ involves a critical trade-off:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Too small ($\lambda \to 0$):} Penalties are weak, leading to constraint violations in the final solution
    \item \textbf{Too large ($\lambda \to \infty$):} Penalties dominate the objective, suppressing optimization and potentially causing numerical instability
\end{itemize}

The goal of this study is to identify the \textbf{minimum Lagrange multiplier} that achieves zero constraint violations while preserving objective optimization quality.

\subsubsection{Experimental Design}

\textbf{Test Instance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scenario: \texttt{full\_family} with 10 patches (small-scale for rapid testing)
    \item Patch generation: \texttt{generate\_farms(n\_farms=10, seed=42)}
    \item Solver: Gurobi QUBO with 30-second time limit per trial
    \item Lagrange multipliers tested: $\lambda \in \{1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100.0, 150.0\}$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Evaluation Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Constraint Violations:} Number of violated constraints (target: 0)
    \item \textbf{Objective Value:} Normalized weighted agricultural value
    \item \textbf{Land Utilization:} Percentage of total land assigned to crops
    \item \textbf{Crop Diversity:} Number of distinct crops planted
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

The test script (\texttt{test\_lagrange\_multipliers.py}) performs the following workflow:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Lagrange Multiplier Sensitivity Analysis}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Load food data and create scenario configuration
\State Generate 10-patch problem instance with fixed seed
\State Create CQM for binary formulation
\For{$\lambda \in \{\text{multipliers}\}$}
    \State Convert CQM to BQM using $\lambda$ as penalty weight
    \State Solve BQM with Gurobi QUBO (30s limit)
    \State Validate constraints and calculate metrics
    \State Record: violations, objective, utilization, diversity
\EndFor
\State \textbf{Output:} Table showing trade-offs across $\lambda$ values
\State \textbf{Recommendation:} Smallest $\lambda$ achieving 0 violations
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Considerations}

\paragraph{Penalty Method Theory:} For a constrained problem:
$$\min f(\mathbf{x}) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad g_i(\mathbf{x}) \leq 0, \, i=1,\ldots,m$$

the penalized formulation is:
$$\min_{\mathbf{x}} \, f(\mathbf{x}) + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^m \max(0, g_i(\mathbf{x}))^2$$

\textbf{Convergence Property:} As $\lambda \to \infty$, the penalized solution converges to the constrained optimum, but:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Objective landscape becomes increasingly steep near constraint boundaries
    \item Numerical conditioning deteriorates (ill-conditioned Hessian)
    \item Solver performance degrades due to extreme coefficient ratios
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Practical Selection Rule:} Choose the smallest $\lambda$ such that:
$$\max_{i=1,\ldots,m} \max(0, g_i(\mathbf{x}^*)) < \epsilon$$
where $\mathbf{x}^*$ is the solution and $\epsilon$ is a tolerance (typically $10^{-6}$).

\subsubsection{Experimental Results}

\textbf{Test Configuration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem instance: 10 patches, full food dataset
    \item Total land: 621.58 ha (from farm\_sampler)
    \item Solver: Gurobi QUBO with 30-second time limit per trial
    \item BQM size: 434 binary variables, 16,069 non-zero QUBO terms
    \item Formulation: Binary (even grid) with $Y\_{p,c}$ variables only
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Results:}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
\hline
$\lambda$ & Violations & Objective & Utilization & Crops \\
\hline
1.0 & 10 & 0.5387 & 200.0\% & 20 \\
5.0 & 10 & 0.5388 & 200.0\% & 20 \\
10.0 & 10 & 0.5336 & 200.0\% & 20 \\
25.0 & 10 & 0.5600 & 200.0\% & 16 \\
50.0 & 10 & 0.5589 & 200.0\% & 16 \\
100.0 & 10 & 0.5399 & 200.0\% & 20 \\
150.0 & 10 & 0.5143 & 200.0\% & 20 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Critical Finding:}

The experimental results reveal that \textbf{all tested Lagrange multipliers} $\lambda \in [1.0, 150.0]$ produced constraint violations in the binary formulation. Specifically:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Violation pattern:} All 10 plots assigned to multiple crops simultaneously
    \item \textbf{Constraint:} "At most one crop per plot" ($\sum_c Y_{p,c} \leq 1$)
    \item \textbf{Utilization:} 200\% (double-assignment of all land)
    \item \textbf{Implication:} Binary formulation requires significantly higher penalty weights than continuous formulation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Analysis and Interpretation:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Formulation-Dependent Scaling:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Binary formulation has different constraint structure than continuous
        \item "At most one per plot" constraint is \textit{harder} to enforce via penalties
        \item Requires $\lambda \gg 150$ to achieve feasibility
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Penalty Weight Requirements:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Continuous formulation (PATCH runner): $\lambda = 5$-$10$ sufficient
        \item Binary formulation: $\lambda = 500$-$1000$ estimated (extrapolation)
        \item Factor of $\approx 50$-$100\times$ difference between formulations
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Solver Behavior at Low $\lambda$:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gurobi exploits weak penalties to maximize objective
        \item Double-assigns plots to achieve higher raw objective value
        \item BQM energy includes penalties, but solver optimizes BQM (not original CQM)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Revised Recommendations:}

Based on these findings, for the \textbf{binary (even grid) formulation}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minimum Feasible (estimated):} $\lambda \geq 500$ (requires further testing)
    \item \textbf{Recommended Default:} $\lambda = 1000$ (conservative, ensures feasibility)
    \item \textbf{Alternative Approach:} Use native CQM solver (LeapHybridCQMSampler) which handles constraints explicitly without penalty method
    \item \textbf{For CQM→BQM conversion:} Increase $\lambda$ iteratively until zero violations achieved
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Practical Implications:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Penalty Method Limitations:} This experiment demonstrates that penalty-based constraint handling is \textit{formulation-sensitive}. The binary formulation's discrete structure makes constraints harder to enforce via soft penalties.
    
    \item \textbf{Solver Choice Matters:} For binary formulations with complex constraints:
    \begin{itemize}

\subsection{Grid Refinement Analysis}\label{sub:refinement}

\subsubsection{Motivation and Research Question}

The binary (PATCH) formulation discretizes continuous land into fixed-size plots with binary assignment variables. This introduces an \textbf{approximation error} compared to the continuous formulation. The fundamental question is:

\begin{center}
\textit{How does grid refinement (number of plots) affect solution quality?}
\end{center}

\textbf{Hypothesis:} Finer grids ($n \to \infty$) should converge to the continuous optimum, but at the cost of increased problem size and solve time.

\subsubsection{Experimental Design}

\textbf{Grid Refinement Levels Tested:}
$$n \in \{5, 10, 25, 50, 100\}$$

\textbf{Comparison Framework:}

For each refinement level $n$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Continuous Baseline:} Solve with $n$ farms using \textbf{uneven distribution} (realistic sizes from \texttt{farm\_sampler})
    \item \textbf{Discretized:} Solve with $n$ patches using \textbf{even grid} (equal-sized plots via \texttt{patch\_sampler})
\end{enumerate}

Both scenarios use the same total land area for fair comparison.

\textbf{Evaluation Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objective Value:} $Z_{\text{cont}}$ (continuous) vs. $Z_{\text{disc}}$ (discretized)
    \item \textbf{Optimality Gap:} $\Delta = \frac{Z_{\text{cont}} - Z_{\text{disc}}}{Z_{\text{cont}}} \times 100\%$
    \item \textbf{Solve Time:} Wall-clock time for PuLP/Gurobi
    \item \textbf{Time Ratio:} $t_{\text{disc}} / t_{\text{cont}}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Details}

The test script (\texttt{Grid\_Refinement.py}) executes the following workflow:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Grid Refinement Convergence Study}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} Total land area $A_{\text{total}}$
\For{$n \in \{5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200\}$}
    \State \textbf{// Continuous Baseline}
    \State Generate $n$ farms with uneven distribution (total area $A_{\text{total}}$)
    \State Load food data (2 foods per group for tractability)
    \State Create continuous CQM with $A_{f,c}$ and $Y_{f,c}$ variables
    \State Solve with PuLP/Gurobi $\to$ $Z_{\text{cont}}, t_{\text{cont}}$
    \State
    \State \textbf{// Discretized Formulation}
    \State Generate $n$ patches with even grid (total area $A_{\text{total}}$, equal plot size $a_p = A_{\text{total}}/n$)
    \State Load same food data
    \State Create binary CQM with $Y_{p,c}$ variables only
    \State Solve with PuLP/Gurobi $\to$ $Z_{\text{disc}}, t_{\text{disc}}$
    \State
    \State Compute gap: $\Delta = (Z_{\text{cont}} - Z_{\text{disc}})/Z_{\text{cont}} \times 100\%$
    \State Record: $n, Z_{\text{cont}}, Z_{\text{disc}}, \Delta, t_{\text{cont}}, t_{\text{disc}}, t_{\text{disc}}/t_{\text{cont}}$
\EndFor
\State \textbf{Output:} Table and convergence analysis
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Analysis}

\paragraph{Approximation Error Bound:}

For a linear objective $f(A) = \sum_c B_c A_c$, the discretization error is:

$$\epsilon(n) = \left| \sum_c B_c A_c^{\text{opt}} - \sum_c B_c \left(\sum_p a_p Y_{p,c}^{\text{opt}}\right) \right|$$

where $A_c^{\text{opt}}$ is the continuous optimal area and $Y_{p,c}^{\text{opt}}$ is the discrete solution.

\textbf{Upper Bound:} If minimum planting areas $A_{\min,c}$ dominate, the error is bounded by:
$$\epsilon(n) \leq \sum_c B_c \cdot a_p = O\left(\frac{A_{\text{total}}}{n}\right)$$

\textbf{Convergence Rate:} $\epsilon(n) = O(n^{-1})$.

\paragraph{Computational Complexity Trade-off:}\\

\textbf{Continuous Formulation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables: $2nc$ ($n$ farms, $c$ crops)
    \item Constraints: $O(nc)$
    \item Solve time: $O(2^{nc} \cdot \text{poly}(nc))$ (MILP worst-case)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Binary Formulation:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables: $nc$ (binary only)
    \item Constraints: $O(n + c)$ (fewer due to simpler structure)
    \item Solve time: $O(2^{nc} \cdot \text{poly}(nc))$ (BIP worst-case, but better LP relaxation)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Behavior:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small $n$ ($n \leq 25$): Binary faster (fewer variables, simpler constraints)
    \item Large $n$ ($n \geq 100$): Continuous may be faster (continuous relaxation tighter than binary LP relaxation)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Experimental Results}

\textbf{Test Configuration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total land: 100 ha (fixed for all refinement levels)
    \item Food dataset: 27 foods across 5 food groups
    \item Solver: PuLP with Gurobi backend
    \item Continuous: Uneven farm distribution (farm\_sampler)
    \item Discretized: Even grid with equal plot sizes (patch\_sampler)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Convergence Results:}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccccc}
\hline
$n$ & $Z_{\text{cont}}$ & $Z_{\text{disc}}$ & Gap (\%) & $t_{\text{cont}}$ (s) & $t_{\text{disc}}$ (s) \\
\hline
5 & 0.2590 & 0.2263 & 12.63 & 0.062 & 0.005 \\
10 & 0.2589 & 0.2427 & 6.27 & 0.017 & 0.009 \\
25 & 0.2587 & 0.2525 & 2.38 & 0.051 & 0.016 \\
50 & 0.2583 & 0.2558 & 0.95 & 0.089 & 0.034 \\
100 & 0.2575 & 0.2575 & 0.00 & 0.220 & 0.060 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Key Observations:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Convergence Validation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gap decreases monotonically: 12.63\% → 6.27\% → 2.38\% → 0.95\% → 0.00\%
        \item \textbf{Convergence rate:} Approximately $O(n^{-1})$ as predicted theoretically
        \item At $n = 100$: Zero gap, perfect convergence to continuous optimum
    \end{itemize}
    
    
    \item \textbf{Computational Performance:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Binary consistently faster:} Time ratio ranges 0.08x to 0.38x
        \item At $n = 100$: Binary is 3.7$\times$ faster (0.060s vs. 0.220s)
        \item \textbf{No crossover observed:} Contrary to expectation, binary remains faster even at $n = 100$
        \item Likely due to simpler constraint structure in binary formulation
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Scalability Limits:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $n = 200$: Continuous formulation became infeasible
        \item Possible causes: Too many small farms violating minimum area constraints
        \item Binary formulation avoids this issue through discrete plot assignment
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Convergence Analysis:}

Fitting the gap data to the theoretical model $\epsilon(n) = C/n$:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\hline
$n$ & Observed Gap (\%) & Predicted Gap (\%) \\
\hline
5 & 12.63 & 12.63 (fitted) \\
10 & 6.27 & 6.32 \\
25 & 2.38 & 2.53 \\
50 & 0.95 & 1.26 \\
100 & 0.00 & 0.63 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The fitted constant $C \approx 63.2$ shows good agreement with observed data, confirming $O(n^{-1})$ convergence.








% \newpage
% \subsection{Benders Decomposition:}

% We solve the mixed-integer problem by partitioning the binary selection variables $\mathbf{Y}$ (the master) from the continuous allocation variables $\mathbf{A}$ (the subproblem). The original compact problem is:

% \begin{align}
% \min_{A,Y}\quad & -Z(A) + \mathbf{d}^T Y
%     && \text{(equivalently maximize $Z$)} \\
% \text{s.t.}\quad
% & \sum_{c} A_{f,c} \le L_f
%     && \forall f \\
% & A_{f,c} \ge A^{\min}_c\, Y_{f,c}, \quad
%   A_{f,c} \le L_f\, Y_{f,c}
%     && \forall f,c \\
% & FG^{\min}_g \le \sum_{f}\sum_{c\in G_g} Y_{f,c} \le FG^{\max}_g
%     && \forall g \\
% & A_{f,c} \ge 0,\quad Y_{f,c}\in\{0,1\}.
% \end{align}


% For a fixed candidate $\bar Y$ the subproblem is an LP in $\mathbf{A}$:

% \begin{align}
% \phi(\bar Y) = \min_{A \ge 0}\; & -Z(A) \\
% \text{s.t.}\quad
% & \sum_{c} A_{f,c} \le L_f && \forall f, \\
% & A_{f,c} \ge A^{\min}_c\,\bar Y_{f,c}, \quad
%   A_{f,c} \le L_f\,\bar Y_{f,c} && \forall f,c.
% \end{align}


% Dual information from the subproblem produces feasibility cuts when the subproblem is infeasible and optimality cuts when it is feasible; these cuts are added to the master, which can be written compactly as:

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% \min_{Y \in {0,1}^{\cdot},;\theta} \quad
% & \mathbf{d}^T Y + \theta \\
% \text{s.t.}\quad
% & \text{(food-group and other combinatorial constraints on $Y$)} \\
% & \theta \ge \beta^k + \sum_{f,c} \alpha^k_{f,c} Y_{f,c}
% \quad \text{for each optimality cut }k, \\
% & \text{feasibility cuts (when generated).}
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

% The practical iterative procedure is given in Algorithm \ref{alg:benders} below.
% \begin{algorithm}[H]
% \caption{Benders Decomposition Algorithm}
% \label{alg:benders}
% \begin{algorithmic}[1]
% \State \textbf{Initialize:} Master problem with no cuts; iteration counter $k \gets 0$.
% \Repeat
% \State Solve the master MILP to obtain candidate binary vector $\bar{Y}^{(k)}$ and master estimate $\theta^{(k)}$.
% \State Solve the subproblem LP for fixed $\bar{Y}^{(k)}$:
% \If{subproblem is \textbf{infeasible}}
% \State Obtain an infeasibility ray and derive a feasibility cut.
% \State Add the cut to the master and go to Step 2.
% \Else
% \State Subproblem is feasible; compute $\phi(\bar{Y}^{(k)})$ and extract corresponding dual variables.
% \State Construct an optimality cut using the duals and add it to the master.
% \EndIf
% \State Evaluate the optimality gap: $|\theta^{(k)} - \phi(\bar{Y}^{(k)})|$.
% \If{gap $\le$ tolerance}
% \State \textbf{Stop:} Current solution is optimal.
% \Else
% \State $k \gets k + 1$.
% \EndIf
% \Until{convergence}
