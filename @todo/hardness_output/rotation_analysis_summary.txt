CRITICAL FINDING: Still Too Easy for Classical Solvers
-------------------------------------------------------

Despite implementing quantum-friendly features (bounded degree, frustration,
spatial locality), Gurobi still solves ALL instances optimally with:

• 0-0.09% integrality gap (LP finds near-integer solutions)
• < 6 seconds for all instances  
• Only 1 branch-and-bound node (solved at root!)
• 0-16% fractional LP variables

WHAT WORKED (Quantum Tractability):
------------------------------------
✅ Bounded max degree: ~29 (embeddable on Pegasus with chains ~2)
✅ Reduced variables: 90-900 vs 2700+ in original
✅ Spatial locality: k=4 neighbors (sparse coupling)
✅ High frustration: 61-75% negative synergies

WHAT DIDN'T WORK (Classical Hardness):
--------------------------------------
❌ Integrality gap: 0-0.09% (target was >5%)
❌ LP relaxation: Finds integer solution directly
❌ Branch-and-bound: No branching needed (1 node)
❌ Fractional variables: 0% in 3/4 scenarios

WHY STILL TOO EASY:
------------------
1. ONE-CROP-PER-PERIOD CONSTRAINT TOO STRONG
   The constraint "sum(Y[f,c,t] for c) == 1" forces exactly one crop per farm
   per period. LP naturally respects this with values 0 or 1.

2. QUADRATIC TERMS HELP LP
   Gurobi converts quadratic to bilinear constraints, which LP handles well
   with modern cutting planes (RLT, BQP).

3. SMALL SEARCH SPACE
   With only 6 crop families and binary decisions, the feasible region is
   small enough for LP to find integer optimum at root.

COMPARISON TO TARGET:
--------------------
                    Target      Achieved    Status
Integrality Gap:    >5%         0-0.09%     ❌ FAIL
Max Degree:         <50         ~29         ✅ PASS
Solve Time (n=200): >60s        6s          ❌ FAIL
Frustration:        50-70%      61-75%      ✅ PASS
Embeddable:         Yes         Yes         ✅ PASS

CONCLUSION:
----------
The rotation formulation is:
• EXCELLENT for quantum (bounded, sparse, embeddable)
• STILL TOO EASY for classical (LP dominates)

This is NOT the sweet spot for quantum advantage!

NEXT STEPS:
----------
Option 1: ACCEPT LIMITED HARDNESS
  - Focus on QPU feasibility demonstration
  - Compare quantum vs classical at SCALE (n=1000+)
  - Acknowledge classical wins for n<1000

Option 2: FURTHER INCREASE HARDNESS
  - Remove one-hot constraint, use penalty instead
  - Increase frustration to 80-90%
  - Add non-local constraints (global diversity, budgets)
  - Use NP-hard planted instances (3-SAT reduction)

Option 3: HYBRID APPROACH
  - Use rotation formulation for subproblems
  - Decompose large instances spatially
  - Solve subproblems on QPU
  - Coordinate with classical outer loop

RECOMMENDATION: Pursue Option 3 (Hybrid Decomposition)
------------------------------------------------------
Your rotation formulation is perfect for:
• Spatially decomposed subproblems (10-20 farms each)
• QPU-solvable chunks (bounded degree)
• Meaningful agricultural structure preserved

Let classical solver handle coordination, QPU handle local optimization.
This is a PRACTICAL path to demonstrating quantum utility!
