ROTATION SCENARIOS - TECHNICAL SUMMARY
================================================================================

WHAT THEY ARE:
--------------
Multi-period crop rotation optimization with spatial interactions and 
frustrated synergies, designed for quantum-classical benchmarking.

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL (e.g., full_family):
--------------------------------------------------

1. TEMPORAL DIMENSION
   Original: Static, single-period assignment
   Rotation: 3-period temporal optimization
   → Models realistic crop rotation over 3 years

2. OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
   Original: Linear (sum of crop benefits)
   Rotation: Quadratic (benefits + rotation synergies + spatial interactions)
   → Native QUBO structure for quantum annealers

3. CROP REPRESENTATION
   Original: 27 individual crops
   Rotation: 6 crop families (Fruits, Grains, Legumes, Vegetables, Proteins)
   → Reduces decision space, bounds max degree

4. SYNERGIES & FRUSTRATION
   Original: No synergies (all crops independent)
   Rotation: 70-88% frustrated interactions (negative synergies)
   → Models disease carryover, nutrient depletion, competition
   → Creates spin-glass-like computational hardness

5. CONSTRAINTS
   Original: Hard one-hot (exactly 1 crop per farm)
   Rotation: Soft one-hot (penalized deviation)
   → Allows LP relaxation to use fractional solutions
   → Creates massive integrality gap (>700%)

6. SPATIAL STRUCTURE
   Original: No spatial interactions
   Rotation: k=4 nearest neighbor coupling
   → Models pest spread, pollination, resource competition
   → Keeps max degree bounded (~29)

MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION:
-------------------------

Objective:
  max Σ_{f,c,t} B_c·L_f·Y_{f,c,t}                    [Linear benefits]
      + γ·Σ_{f,c,c',t} R_{c,c'}·L_f·Y_{f,c,t-1}·Y_{f,c',t}  [Rotation synergies]
      + γ_s·Σ_{neighbors(f,f'),c,c',t} S_{c,c'}·Y_{f,c,t}·Y_{f',c',t}  [Spatial]
      - P·Σ_{f,t} (Σ_c Y_{f,c,t} - 1)²              [Soft one-hot penalty]
      + δ·Σ_{f,c,t} Y_{f,c,t}                        [Diversity bonus]

Where:
  Y_{f,c,t} ∈ {0,1}: Farm f grows family c in period t
  R_{c,c'}: Rotation synergy matrix (70-88% negative entries)
  γ ∈ [0.20, 0.35]: Rotation strength
  P ∈ [1.5, 3.0]: One-hot penalty (lower = harder)
  δ ∈ [0.15, 0.25]: Diversity bonus

Constraints:
  Σ_c Y_{f,c,t} ≤ 2  ∀f,t  [Allow up to 2 crops, but penalize deviation]

COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES:
-------------------------

Classical (Gurobi):
  Variables:     90-900 (vs 2700 in original)
  Integrality gap: >700% (vs 0% in original)
  Solve time:    >300s timeout (vs <1s in original)
  BB nodes:      77K-2.5M (vs 1 in original)
  Status:        VERY HARD ✓✓✓

Quantum (D-Wave):
  Max degree:    ~29 (bounded!)
  Embeddable:    Yes, with chains ~2-3
  QPU topology:  Fits Pegasus graph
  Status:        FEASIBLE ✓

SCENARIOS:
----------
rotation_micro_25:   5 farms  × 6 families × 3 periods = 90 vars
rotation_small_50:   10 farms × 6 families × 3 periods = 180 vars
rotation_medium_100: 20 farms × 6 families × 3 periods = 360 vars
rotation_large_200:  50 farms × 6 families × 3 periods = 900 vars

All scenarios: 70-88% frustration, soft constraints, diversity bonus

AGRONOMIC REALISM:
------------------
✓ Crop rotation is standard practice in sustainable agriculture
✓ Negative synergies represent real phenomena:
  - Nutrient depletion (monoculture)
  - Disease carryover (pathogen persistence)
  - Allelopathy (chemical inhibition)
  - Pest harbor (consecutive same-family planting)
✓ Positive synergies represent benefits:
  - Nitrogen fixation (legumes → grains)
  - Pest control (companion planting)
  - Soil structure improvement

THE QUANTUM ADVANTAGE HYPOTHESIS:
---------------------------------
Classical solvers struggle because:
  1. Quadratic objective creates large search space
  2. Soft constraints allow LP to cheat with fractions
  3. Frustrated synergies create local minima
  4. Branch-and-bound explores exponentially many nodes

Quantum annealers may succeed because:
  1. Native QUBO mapping (quadratic → qubit couplings)
  2. Quantum tunneling escapes local minima
  3. No branch-and-bound (different search mechanism)
  4. Sparse coupling (k=4) fits hardware topology

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Benchmark on D-Wave QPU (Advantage_system6)
2. Compare: QPU vs SA vs Gurobi (timeout)
3. Measure time-to-solution, solution quality
4. Document quantum advantage (if found)
