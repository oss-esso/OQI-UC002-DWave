# LaTeX Report: Implicit vs. Explicit Constraint Encoding in QUBO

This directory contains a comprehensive LaTeX report analyzing the differences between PATCH and BQUBO formulations for quantum optimization.

## File

- `constraint_encoding_analysis.tex` - Main LaTeX document

## Contents

The report includes:

1. **Introduction** - Overview of QUBO constraint encoding challenges
2. **Problem Formulation** - Mathematical definitions of PATCH and BQUBO
3. **Theoretical Analysis** - Why BQUBO achieves implicit constraint satisfaction
4. **Empirical Analysis** - Complexity and performance comparisons
5. **Alternative Encoding Strategies** - Domain-wall, unary, and hybrid approaches
6. **Theoretical Implications** - Constraint encodability hierarchy
7. **Recommendations** - Practical guidelines for formulation design
8. **References** - 10 recent research papers from arXiv and journals

## Key Findings

- PATCH formulation: **14× more quadratic terms** than BQUBO (50-unit case)
- PATCH formulation: **3.4× higher density** than BQUBO
- Gurobi solve time: **316× faster** on BQUBO vs PATCH
- Constraint violations: **0** in BQUBO, **25-52** in PATCH even with large penalties

## Abstract

> This report analyzes the fundamental differences between two Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) formulations for agricultural crop optimization: the PATCH (plot assignment) formulation and the BQUBO (binary plantation) formulation. We demonstrate why the PATCH formulation requires explicit constraint encoding through penalty terms while the BQUBO formulation achieves implicit constraint satisfaction through its variable structure. Our empirical analysis shows that the PATCH formulation results in 14× more quadratic terms and 3.4× higher model density, leading to significantly harder optimization problems.
