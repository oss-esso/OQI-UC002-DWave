## Key Insights

### 1. **Scaling Characteristics**
- **D-Wave QPU**: Exhibits near-constant or slowly growing solve times
- **Classical Solvers**: Show significant time increases with problem complexity
- **Quantum Advantage**: Most pronounced for medium-to-large scale NLN problems

### 2. **Problem Type Differences**
- **NLN**: D-Wave shows dramatic speedups (up to 996x) due to constant QPU time
- **BQUBO**: More moderate speedups, but still competitive at relevant scales
- **Hybrid Approach**: Balances quantum speed with classical reliability

### 3. **Practical Implications**
- **Small Problems (< 20 farms)**: Classical solvers may be sufficient
- **Medium Problems (20-300 farms)**: D-Wave QPU shows clear advantages
- **Large Problems (> 300 farms)**: Quantum approach becomes increasingly beneficial

### 4. **Visualization Scales**
- **Linear Scale**: Shows absolute time differences clearly
- **Log-Y Scale**: Reveals exponential growth patterns in classical solvers
- **Log-Log Scale**: Highlights power-law relationships and scaling behavior

## Conclusion

The benchmarks demonstrate that **D-Wave quantum computing provides significant speedups** for optimization problems, particularly:
- Non-linear problems (NLN) at medium-to-large scales
- Problems where classical solvers struggle with complexity
- Use cases requiring consistent, predictable solve times

The hybrid approach offers a practical balance, combining quantum speed with classical optimization techniques for production-ready solutions.
