# Task List: Constraint Violation Analysis Completion

## Phase 1: Data Collection ✅
- [x] Run diagnostic with 10 variables
- [x] Analyze results and identify root cause
- [x] Run diagnostic with 50 variables for comprehensive data

## Phase 2: Documentation ✅
- [x] Create LaTeX technical report with:
  - [x] Executive summary
  - [x] Methodology section
  - [x] Results analysis with tables and figures
  - [x] Coefficient scaling analysis
  - [x] Root cause explanation
  - [x] Recommendations section

## Phase 3: Scaled BQUBO Implementation ✅
- [x] Theoretical explanation of scaled BQUBO approach
- [x] Implement scaled BQUBO formulation that:
  - [x] Accepts variable-sized plots (not just 1-acre)
  - [x] Properly normalizes coefficients
  - [x] Scales benefits proportionally to plot size
  - [x] Maintains BQUBO's well-behaved properties
- [x] Document the mathematical formulation

## Phase 4: Gurobi QUBO Comparison Script ✅
- [x] Create simple, educational script that:
  - [x] Generates 4 scenarios with 10 variables each:
    1. BQUBO (original, 1-acre plots)
    2. Scaled BQUBO (variable-sized plots with normalization)
    3. PATCH (with idle penalty)
    4. PATCH_NO_IDLE (without idle penalty)
  - [x] Converts each to QUBO format
  - [x] Solves with Gurobi's QUBO solver
  - [x] Compares results side-by-side
  - [x] Well-commented for learning purposes
  - [x] Includes step-by-step output

## Phase 5: Final Deliverables ✅
- [x] LaTeX report created (technical_report.tex)
- [x] All scripts working correctly
- [x] Create README for the new comparison script
- [x] Memory file with key takeaways created

## Summary of Deliverables
